## Background jobs

Cron schedules and CF Queues are declared in two places that must stay
in sync: `appapprove.config.ts` (handler dispatch) and `wrangler.toml`
(`[triggers]` + `[[queues.*]]`). The deploy pipeline diffs the two on
every push and warns when they drift.

To add an hourly cleanup job:

1. `app/crons/cleanup.ts` - write your handler (see `example-cleanup.ts`)
2. `appapprove.config.ts` - add `"0 * * * *": "~/crons/cleanup"` to `crons`
3. `wrangler.toml` - uncomment `[triggers]` and add the same schedule
